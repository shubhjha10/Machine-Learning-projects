1. Regarding my 'Mine prediction' project, here i follow a general work flow to accomplish the goal of my project
The data file of the 'Mine prediction' project [Copy of sonar data.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/16127093/Copy.of.sonar.data.csv)
Work flow : 1. Loading the data and then analysing it using head,shape, describe and value counts functions
            2. Creating out test and train data set, we first do this by seperating the label from the features, so that we can split the label into test and train aswell. As that is the basis on which we test our data on both train and test set
            3. We load our logistic regression training model under a variable and train it with our label and feature training set
            4. Evaluating our model using accuracy score with our training and test training data set 
            5. Getting user input and printing the outcome for one row, a set of features.

2. Credit card fraud detection: Here are the steps I followed to complete this project:
 Data Collection: I gathered the necessary data, ensuring it was relevant and comprehensive for the problem at hand.
Data Preprocessing: I balanced the dataset by applying appropriate techniques to address data imbalance, preparing it for analysis.
Data Analysis: I explored the dataset, examining key features and relationships between variables to gain deeper insights.
Data Splitting: I split the dataset into training and test sets, using the training data to build the model and reserving the test data for evaluation.
Model Training: Since the problem involved binary classification, I applied a logistic regression model to predict the outcomes.
Model Evaluation: I used the test data to evaluate the model's performance, ensuring accuracy and reliability in the predictions.

3. K-means customer clustering: The aim of K-means clustering is to minimize the distance between data points within a cluster. It is a centroid-based algorithm, meaning it calculates distances to assign points to clusters. The objective is to minimize the sum of distances between points and their respective cluster centroids.

Optimization:
The algorithm uses optimization to find the best set of centroids that minimize the sum of squared distances between each point and its nearest centroid.

Steps for K-Means Clustering:
Initialization: I select K points from the dataset as the initial centroids.
Assignment: For each data point, I calculate its distance to each centroid and assign it to the cluster with the nearest centroid, forming K clusters.
Centroid Update: After all points are assigned, I calculate the mean of each cluster and update the centroids accordingly.
Iteration: I repeat the assignment and centroid update steps until convergence. Convergence occurs either when a set number of iterations is reached or when the centroids no longer change significantly.
